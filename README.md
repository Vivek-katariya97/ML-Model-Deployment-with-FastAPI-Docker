# ML-Model-Deployment-with-FastAPI-Docker
ML model deployment project using FastAPI and Docker. Built a REST API to serve trained model predictions with proper input validation and model loading. Containerized the application to ensure consistent deployment across environments and tested endpoints locally to verify reliable inference and error handling.
